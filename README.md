# COAD
## Computer Organization and Design
Just a place to post the code I wrote for this class, and possibly even to post the code for the main project in the class. It is currently in stage 2 of design, which is implimentation of the data path. Phase 1 consisted of coming up with the assembly language and a few other details, like the name of the microprocessor design. The name is BISC, or Basic Instruction Set Computer. The assemby code goes by the same name.

### What you can find in this repository:
- C code to x86 Assembly (to help learn MIPS Assembly)
- MIPS Assembly (todo, help learn Assembly)
- BISC Assembly (todo, for my group project)
- VHDL for the microprocessor (todo, for group project)
- Memory Loader (todo, for group project)
- BISC Assembler (todo, for group project)

### Writing C code and seeing how it looks in x86 Assembly
- swap.c & swap.S - A simple swap function  
Viewing what happens when GCC turns C into x86 Assembly, and commenting on what it does.
Mostly to help learn MIPS Assembly. It's similar enough and allows me to compare C code to Assembly.

### MIPS Assembly
TODO - MIPS Assembly written by me, to help learn the assembly language.

### BISC Assembly
TODO - BISC Assembly written by me, for the microprocessor for testing.

### VHDL for the BISC microprocessor
TODO - Might not get posted since it would provide future students taking the course our own work, but I'll see what I can do.

### Memory Loader
- memLoad.py  
memLoad.py is a simple script used to automate the process of recieving a binary file and loading it into BISC's memory. This task is done by modifying the actual VHDL file that contains the memory unit.

### BISC Assembler
TODO - Other group member offered to write it, but I might try to make my own at some point. If and when that is done, I'll upload it here.
